# Vanish++
<div align="center">

## 👻 The Absolute Standard for Modern Admin Stealth.

**Stop getting caught. Start watching.**

</div>

---

Are you tired of "vanish" plugins that leave traces? Players tab-completing your name? Arrows bouncing off your invisible body? Mobs looking strangely at "empty" air?

**Vanish++** renders other vanish plugins obsolete. Built exclusively for modern **Paper** servers, it utilizes advanced packet interception, native physics manipulation, and deep API hooks to ensure you are **mathematically undetectable**.

It works perfectly out of the box with zero configuration required, but offers granular control for those who need it.

## 🚀 Why Vanish++ is Unrivaled

<details>
<summary><b>🛡️ The "Matrix" Physics Engine (True Intangibility)</b></summary>
<br>

Most plugins just hide you visually. **Vanish++ removes you physically.**

*   **Titan God Mode:** While vanished, you are strictly invincible. You take no damage, are immune to all potion effects, and cannot burn. You are a spectator in survival mode.
*   **Smart Mob AI (True Sight):** Mobs completely ignore vanished players. Targeting is cancelled via `EntityTargetEvent` before the mob ever commits to an attack path. Mobs that had already locked on before you vanished are force-detargeted immediately.
*   **Projectile Pass-Through:** We don't use "teleport hacks." Using native Paper events, arrows, tridents, and snowballs fly **physically through** your body. It is impossible to hit a vanished player.
*   **Zero Collision:** You cannot push players, mobs, or boats, and they cannot push you. You are a ghost.
*   **No Physical Triggers:** You can walk over Turtle Eggs, Crops, Pressure Plates, Tripwires, and Sculk Sensors without triggering a single vibration or block update.
*   **Raid Prevention:** You won't trigger Bad Omen raids while watching a village.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>📶 Deep Protocol Invisibility (Packet-Level Hiding)</b></summary>
<br>

We hook directly into the server protocol to scrub your existence from clients. *(Requires ProtocolLib)*

*   **Nuclear Tab-Completion Scrubbing:** If a normal player tries to Tab-Complete your name in Chat, Vanilla Commands, or Plugin Commands, **you are not there**. Your name is stripped from the packet sent to the client.
*   **Server List Hiding:** The player count in the multiplayer server list is mathematically adjusted. If you are the only one online, the server says "0/20".
*   **Ghost View for Staff:** While normal players see nothing, Staff (with permission) see vanished players in the Tab List as **Gray, Italicized Spectators**, making it easy to coordinate.
*   **Staff Glow Indicator:** Vanished players render with a glowing outline for staff — a clear visual indicator injected at the packet level. Non-staff never see it. Configurable via `vanish-appearance.staff-glow`.
*   **Dynmap & EssentialsX Hooks:** Automatically hides you from dynamic web maps and `/who`, `/list`, or `/online` commands.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>👁️ Immersion & Compatibility</b></summary>
<br>

*   **Native Language Fake Messages:** When you vanish, the fake "Player left the game" message isn't just text—it uses the **server's native translation packet**. This means a German player sees the message in German, and a US player sees it in English. It is indistinguishable from a real disconnect.
*   **Native TAB Plugin Support:** If you use **TAB (by NEZNAMY)**, Vanish++ hooks directly into it to display your vanish prefix automatically. No manual Placeholder configuration required.
*   **Legacy Plugin Support:** Even without specific hooks, Vanish++ sets standard Bukkit Metadata (`"vanished"`). This means plugins like **CMI**, **TAB**, or custom skripts automatically respect your vanished status.
*   **Silent Chests:** Open Chests, Shulker Boxes, Barrels, and Ender Chests silently. The container is opened as a snapshot inventory — no animation, no sound, full item interaction. Changes sync back on close.
*   **DiscordSRV Integration:** Registers as a native vanish hook in DiscordSRV. Join, quit, advancement, and death announcements are all suppressed on Discord — even if you reconnect while already vanished. Fake join/leave messages honour DiscordSRV's full embed, colour, avatar, and webhook configuration from `messages.yml`. Staff notifications still appear in console and for players with the see permission.
*   **Simple Voice Chat Integration:** Automatically isolates/mutes you in voice chat so you can't be heard or hear proximity chat while stalking.
*   **Smart Item Pickup:** Toggle item pickup with `/vanishpickup`. Don't accidentally steal the diamonds you are watching a player mine.

<details>
<summary><b>🔧 Granular Control & Safety</b></summary>
<br>

*   **Spectator Quick-Switch:** Double-tap Shift while vanished to enter Spectator mode instantly. Double-tap again to return to your previous gamemode. Unvanishing forces you back automatically. Requires `vanishpp.spectator`. (`vanishpp.spectator.bypass` lets you stay in Spectator after unvanishing.)
*   **Live Config Editor (`/vconfig`):** Edit any setting in `config.yml` (Messages, Rules, Boolean toggles) directly in-game. Changes apply instantly without reloading.
*   **Interactive Help (`/vhelp`):** Forget the wiki. The plugin includes a clickable, interactive guide explaining every command and feature.
*   **Smart-Merge Migration:** Updates are stress-free. The plugin automatically detects old configs and migrates your custom messages/settings to the new version structure safely.
*   **Personal Rules System (`/vrules`):** Decide exactly what you want to do.
    *   *Want to break blocks?* Toggle it.
    *   *Want absolute peace?* Disable "Can Hit Entities".
    *   *Afraid of leaking info?* Enable "Chat Confirmation".
    *   *Need to drop items?* Enable "Can Drop Items".
*   **Vanish Scoreboard (`/vscoreboard`):** A fully configurable sidebar scoreboard shown automatically when you vanish. Displays world, TPS, player counts, real-time coordinates and direction, biome, ping, health, food, armor, time, and more. Coordinates refresh the instant you move via packet-level ProtocolLib listening — no tick lag. Supports all built-in placeholders plus full PlaceholderAPI. Column separators (`|`) are auto-aligned regardless of label length. Configured in `scoreboards.yml`, reloads with `/vreload`.
*   **Heartbeat Synchronization:** Changed a permission in LuckPerms? Promoted someone via Console? The **Heartbeat Task** refreshes visuals instantly. No relogging required.
*   **Setup Advisor:** On every startup, the plugin scans the active config and warns you if a hook is enabled but its dependency is missing, or if a PlaceholderAPI placeholder is used without PlaceholderAPI installed. Warnings are printed to the console *and* shown in-chat to all staff with `vanishpp.see` — so you always know when your setup is incomplete.
*   **Dependency Warnings:** The plugin intelligently warns admins if ProtocolLib is missing, but allows you to silence these warnings permanently with `/vignore`.
*   **Accidental Chat Prevention:** If enabled, typing in chat blocks the message and asks you to confirm with `/vchat confirm`. Never leak your presence by accident again.
*   **Async Data Persistence:** All data is saved asynchronously. Server crash? Restart? Your vanish state is saved instantly. No accidental logins.
*   **Native Velocity Proxy Plugin:** The companion `vanishpp-velocity` plugin provides a dedicated real-time messaging channel between all Paper servers and Velocity. Vanish state, config changes, and `/vanishreload` propagate network-wide instantly. Timed rule expiry notifications are delivered to the server the player is currently on — no reconnect required. Servers auto-detect the proxy on startup and fall back to standalone mode if none is present.
*   **Database Connection Monitoring:** When database connectivity fails, staff are notified in-game so infrastructure issues don't go unnoticed. Includes graceful error handling and connection pooling.
